# Integrating Azure AD into an ASP.NET Core web app
This sample shows how to build a .Net MVC web application that uses OpenID Connect to sign-in users from a single Azure Active Directory tenant, using the ASP.Net Core OpenID Connect middleware.

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

> This sample has been updated to ASP.NET Core 1.0.  Looking for previous versions of this code sample? Check out the tags on the [releases](../../releases) GitHub page.

## How To Run This Sample

Getting started is simple!  To run this sample you will need:
- Install .NET Core for Windows by following the instructions at [dot.net/core](https://dot.net/core), which will include Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, please see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/) 
- A user account in your Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a Microsoft account, so if you signed in to the Azure portal with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect-aspnetcore.git`

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
3. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
4. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
5. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet' and select 'Web Application and/or Web API' as the Application Type. For the sign-on URL, enter the redirect URI for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44353/signin-oidc`. Click on **Create** to create the application.
6. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
7. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.
8. In the same page, change the `logoutUrl` property to `https://localhost:44353/Account/EndSession`.  This is the default single sign out URL for this sample.
9. For the App ID URI, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant. 

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure Active Directory tenant

1. Open the solution in VS Code.
2. Copy the `config.json` file to `config.user.json`.
3. Find the `Tenant` property and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
4. Find the `ClientId` and replace the value with the Application ID from the Azure portal.
5. If you changed the base URL of the sample, find the app key `ida:PostLogoutRedirectUri` and replace the value with the new base URL of the sample.

### Step 4:  Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.

Click the sign-in link on the homepage of the application to sign-in.  On the Azure AD sign-in page, enter the name and password of a user account that is in your Azure AD tenant.

## About The Code

This sample shows how to use the OpenID Connect ASP.Net Core middleware to sign-in users from a single Azure AD tenant.  The middleware is initialized in the `Startup.cs` file, by passing it the Client ID of the application and the URL of the Azure AD tenant where the application is registered.  The middleware then takes care of:
- Downloading the Azure AD metadata, finding the signing keys, and finding the issuer name for the tenant.
- Processing OpenID Connect sign-in responses by validating the signature and issuer in an incoming JWT, extracting the user's claims, and putting them on ClaimsPrincipal.Current.
- Integrating with the session cookie ASP.Net Core middleware to establish a session for the user. 

You can trigger the middleware to send an OpenID Connect sign-in request by decorating a class or method with the `[Authorize]` attribute, or by issuing a challenge,
```C#
await HttpContext.Authentication.ChallengeAsync(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
```
Similarly you can send a signout request,
```C#
await HttpContext.Authentication.SignOutAsync(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
await HttpContext.Authentication.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
```
When a user is signed out, they will be redirected to the `Post_Logout_Redirect_Uri` specified when the OpenID Connect middleware is initialized.

All of the middleware in this project is created as a part of the open source [Asp.Net Security](https://github.com/aspnet/Security) project.
